In my free time, I like to hike, bike, canoe, kayak and garden. When I travel, I seek out wilderness and other natural areas to escape, reflect and relax, as well as explore archeological sites to contemplate and be amazed by previous civilizations. It is the thoughts and questions I have while engaging in these pastimes that blazed the path of my career and are why I have degrees in anthropology, forestry and natural resources. I’ve always been curious about the human-nature relationship – aren’t you?
